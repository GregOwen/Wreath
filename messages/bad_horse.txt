Bad Horse
Bad Horse
Bad Horse
He's bad
He rides across the nation,
The Thoroughbred of Sin
He got the application that you just sent in!
It needs evaluation, so let the games begin
A heinous crime, a show of force
(A murder would be nice of course)
Bad Horse
Bad Horse
Bad Horse
He's bad
The Evil League of Evil
Is watching, so beware:
The grade that you receive will
Be your last, we swear!
So make the Bad Horse gleeful,
Or he'll make you his mare...
You're saddled up
There's no recourse
It's "Hi-Ho, Silver!"
-- Signed, Bad Horse
